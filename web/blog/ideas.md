2020 is approaching fast and a whole new decade beckons. Recent tech has been just too damn exciting and I think it will become more so in the next decade. I have set aside some time to jot down a number of things I wish to explore and share with you via this blog next year and way beyond that. I'm buzzing!

# Code
My main source of income as a freelance/contractor is writing code (sites and apps) and mostly using the ubiqutous JavaScript, it's what this site is built upon (Gridsome). It is in itself a rapidly expanding, fast developing industry and in order to stay up-to-date, I find writing about it helps. There will be a multitude of articles here about this, there is no doubt!

## code explorations

List of concepts I wish to explore and share with other developers out there, mostly around Vue and JS:

- What's coming up for VueJS in 2020?
- Gridsome, Gatsby and so on
- Alternatives to Gridsome
- Sanity.io
  - How easy is it to set up a Sanity website? How much tech know-how do you need?
    - Developers and Users
      - In most cases I can take care of the technical side and then provide the user with the introduction they need to the software itself and how it works
      - I will receive notifications when builds complete successfully or fail
    - Getting developers up to speed
      - You need Node installed and then follow the next set of steps
    - Training users 
- Alternatives to Sanity
- Nuxt
- New JS frameworks such as Svelte, oh my!
- JavaScript
  - re-visit the fundamentals from time to time
- CSS
- VueJs
- Browsers

## Be a better JS developer

- re-visit the fundamentals from time to time


## VUE/Gridsome plugins and components

## CMS systems

- Advanced Sanity.io
- Keeping up-to-date with their new features, some of which include:
  - [ ] https://www.sanity.io/blog/evolve-authoring-experiences-with-views-and-split-panes
    - this looks really interesting indeed and I plan to get my teeth into this 

## Node/API/Backends

## headless

## Serverless

## code tutorials

## Git

## Mobile development

- react native or https://www.nativescript.org/vue?

## Drone tech

I am seriously tempted by the Mavic Mini but shall still register myself for the larger Mavic Pro that I already own. I am also looking seriously into getting a PfCO license because that will open up some commercial possibilities, such as learning how to develop apps for the drones I own. I don't have any ideas in particular yet.

## Mapping out what I've learnt from FB

## AI and Machine Learning

What are the best options for JS developers?

## IoT Javascript

## Other people's learning resources

- Wes Bos
- Level Up

## iPhone tech

## this website

- add Disqus back in
