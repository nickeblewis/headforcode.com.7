Today I’m eating cake and drinking latte at a cafe in the middle of nowhere but it’s busy here. I’m people watching and earwigging conversations. I’m trying to guess what people here do, that’s fun. Most of them are retired just by their age group but some are younger like myself. That guy in the corner, could he be web guy too? He has the beard. I dint have a beard never fancied one. I don’t have tattoos either, that’s popular these days. I write this with amusement because I’ve escaped my usual environment and feel liberated. My words feel less confined too they fly out of my fingers and do a little loop the looo before settling down on the page. 

I notice the opinionated old couple next to me. The old gent tsks at me tapping away on my phone but I’m writing this, he doesn’t know. Why do I think they are opinionated? They were having one of those conversations that only a couple who’ve been together for so long can have, the wife killing the conversation her husband is trying to make with silent punctuation. The poor old chap being left to deliver his own monologue to himself. They get up to leave. 

My mind has clearly drifted but that’s good. I have to do this sometimes. I don’t do it enough. To lose myself in the wilderness of other people’s irrelevant conversations helps detach my mind from its shackles and run a little bit wild itself. 

life recently has been drowned in too much noise and I am trying to find a rhythm once more. It gets you down and that is the reason this week I’ve taken the week off. Nobody is making sense around me and I’ve started to lose it a bit. Never good. 

walks are of course great to help you blow away the cobwebs and find new angles for so much. So apart from doing some Christmas shopping this week which I’m actually relishing this year because it is in itself something different and entertaining. I never thought I’d say that but Christmas is good. 

however now Is the perfect time to refine my plans and I do this using a tool called Notion. Have you come across it? This reminds me of some posts I should write about the tools I use and that you could find handy. 

that latte and fluent free carrot cake has helped and I feel a whole lot better. Cafes are the perfect tonic for impending madnesses!
