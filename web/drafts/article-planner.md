# Articles that are ready and should go out now
- [*] My jokey coffee shop piece
- [*] Portsmouth (which has already gone out)
- [*] Italian Scooters next week or maybe something more solid if I get it written in time

# To follow on from the 2020 article
The last long form article of 2019 published 18/12/2019 featured 10 key areas of interest, that were:

## 1. Smartphones as main cameras, has the time come
To follow on from this I want to blog/vlog about the different apps you can use for both photography and video, there are many but for the foreseeable, I want to concentrate on these:

- Native camera app
- LR camera
- Filmic
- DJI Mimo


## 2. Drones
## 3. Future of photography
## 4. The Gimbal
## 5. Home automation
## 6. Electric vehicles
## 7. Self powered homes
## 8. AI and ML
## 9. coding 
## 10. Future of work

# Notion.so
# Connecting IA Writer with this site
- did have it working but now don't

# Photography and Filmaking
I want to focus on small scale gear to prove to people they don't need the biggest, most expensive all of the time and how this can be used alongside a more full-size camera kit - together.

# Code
My main source of income as a freelance/contractor is writing code (sites and apps) and mostly using the ubiqutous JavaScript, it's what this site is built upon (Gridsome). It is in itself a rapidly expanding, fast developing industry and in order to stay up-to-date, I find writing about it helps. There will be a multitude of articles here about this, there is no doubt!

I would love to make some extra revenue out of building online courses and e-books, so capturing my thoughts and ideas against this website is the best way of doing that.

## code explorations

List of concepts I wish to explore and share with other developers out there, mostly around Vue and JS:

- What's coming up for VueJS in 2020? Well v3 is almost here or is it here?
- Gridsome, Gatsby and so on
- Alternatives to Gridsome
- Sanity.io
  - How easy is it to set up a Sanity website? How much tech know-how do you need?
    - Developers and Users
      - In most cases I can take care of the technical side and then provide the user with the introduction they need to the software itself and how it works
      - I will receive notifications when builds complete successfully or fail
    - Getting developers up to speed
      - You need Node installed and then follow the next set of steps
    - Training users 
- Alternatives to Sanity
- Nuxt
- Next
- Yeah what about react?
- New JS frameworks such as Svelte, oh my!
- JavaScript
  - re-visit the fundamentals from time to time
- CSS
- VueJs
- Browsers and their capabilities/differences

# Other topics

- [ ] Will rethink the headings for this doc

# Notion

## Introduction to Notion.so
- Where to find it
- A quick tour of it's features
- Have a look at my public content for an example


## Using Notion.so to run your life
I use Notion to run my business but the challenge is in knowing how best to use the tool because of it's flexibility, there are umpteen ways you can use it. My suggestions here aren't gospel, just ideas but they have become reliable enough for me to find useful and help me (a very disorganised person) cope better and not lose my rag with things

## Using Notion to write markdown articles
- Start off capturing articles in Notion
- flesh them out
- complete them
- export the article to your gridsome site - how?
  - Export as a markdown file complete with images
  - Drop into your gridsome blog folder

# More other stuff!

## Go out, take a stroll and take photos series for Write52

## Gridsome/Sanity getting started

How did I build this website, hee are the steps for the more technically minded people out there

## VUE/Gridsome plugins and components

## CMS systems

- Advanced Sanity.io
- Keeping up-to-date with their new features, some of which include:
  - [ ] https://www.sanity.io/blog/evolve-authoring-experiences-with-views-and-split-panes
    - this looks really interesting indeed and I plan to get my teeth into this 

## Node/API/Backends

## headless

## Serverless

## code tutorials

## Git

## Mobile development

- react native or https://www.nativescript.org/vue?

## Drone tech

I am seriously tempted by the Mavic Mini but shall still register myself for the larger Mavic Pro that I already own. I am also looking seriously into getting a PfCO license because that will open up some commercial possibilities, such as learning how to develop apps for the drones I own. I don't have any ideas in particular yet.
