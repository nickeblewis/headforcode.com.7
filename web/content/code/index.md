I have for many years worked with "code" or "programming" as we used to call it and since currently I am working with the fabulous Vue.js framework, I thought it was high time I started to write about it and to offer my own range of courses to teach others why it is so brilliant and to build wonderful apps of your own.

There are a whole load of learninb resources online and I want to offer something a bit different that will fit in better with your busy day. You want to learn the new stuff or brush up on what you've done in the past but can't quite recall. In the meantime, here are some of the best resources that inspire me.
