# 20 things to get excited about in 2020 and the new decade
- [ ] this is an article idea to get out next week as my last for the year! It will set the agenda for the 2020 blog too


2020 is approaching fast and a whole new decade beckons. Recent tech has been just too damn exciting and I think it will become more so in the next decade. I have set aside some time to jot down a number of things I wish to explore and share with you via this blog next year and way beyond that. I'm buzzing!

I pick out 10 (1 for each year in the decade, see what I did there?) things that will evolve so rapidly in the next few years, god knows what they will be like in 2030? Well if this post still exists at that point in time, we can look back and see...

I will delve more into all of these topics in 2020 as I explore each one in more depth, I've always fancied improving the automation of our home and perhaps investing in a solar panel or two.

- [ ] ten subjects I can rabbit on about
- Smartphones as main cameras, has the time come?
  - quality is now very good, not just "good" but "very good" plus the computational or AI possibilities open up a whole host of choices for people to edit their images on the go. Will the time come when you no longer need to download to a PC to edit? I can confidently say that it is already possible right mnow
- Drones and unmanned flight
- Future of photography
- Home automation
- Electric cars
- Self-powered homes
- Super powerful laptops
- Artificial Intelligence
- The future of the Web and Mobile
- Programming in the 2020s
- The future of work

- [ ] Maybe...
- Will we eat less meat?
- The future of medicine
- Will any of us experience space flight?
- Social media
- Banking

# Connecting IA Writer with this site
- did have it working but now don't


# Code
My main source of income as a freelance/contractor is writing code (sites and apps) and mostly using the ubiqutous JavaScript, it's what this site is built upon (Gridsome). It is in itself a rapidly expanding, fast developing industry and in order to stay up-to-date, I find writing about it helps. There will be a multitude of articles here about this, there is no doubt!

I would love to make some extra revenue out of building online courses and e-books, so capturing my thoughts and ideas against this website is the best way of doing that.

## code explorations

List of concepts I wish to explore and share with other developers out there, mostly around Vue and JS:

- What's coming up for VueJS in 2020? Well v3 is almost here or is it here?
- Gridsome, Gatsby and so on
- Alternatives to Gridsome
- Sanity.io
  - How easy is it to set up a Sanity website? How much tech know-how do you need?
    - Developers and Users
      - In most cases I can take care of the technical side and then provide the user with the introduction they need to the software itself and how it works
      - I will receive notifications when builds complete successfully or fail
    - Getting developers up to speed
      - You need Node installed and then follow the next set of steps
    - Training users 
- Alternatives to Sanity
- Nuxt
- Next
- Yeah what about react?
- New JS frameworks such as Svelte, oh my!
- JavaScript
  - re-visit the fundamentals from time to time
- CSS
- VueJs
- Browsers and their capabilities/differences

# Other topics

- [ ] Will rethink the headings for this doc

# Notion

## Introduction to Notion.so
- Where to find it
- A quick tour of it's features
- Have a look at my public content for an example


## Using Notion.so to run your life
I use Notion to run my business but the challenge is in knowing how best to use the tool because of it's flexibility, there are umpteen ways you can use it. My suggestions here aren't gospel, just ideas but they have become reliable enough for me to find useful and help me (a very disorganised person) cope better and not lose my rag with things

## Using Notion to write markdown articles
- Start off capturing articles in Notion
- flesh them out
- complete them
- export the article to your gridsome site - how?
  - Export as a markdown file complete with images
  - Drop into your gridsome blog folder

# More other stuff!

## Go out, take a stroll and take photos series for Write52

## Gridsome/Sanity getting started

How did I build this website, hee are the steps for the more technically minded people out there

## VUE/Gridsome plugins and components

## CMS systems

- Advanced Sanity.io
- Keeping up-to-date with their new features, some of which include:
  - [ ] https://www.sanity.io/blog/evolve-authoring-experiences-with-views-and-split-panes
    - this looks really interesting indeed and I plan to get my teeth into this 

## Node/API/Backends

## headless

## Serverless

## code tutorials

## Git

## Mobile development

- react native or https://www.nativescript.org/vue?

## Drone tech

I am seriously tempted by the Mavic Mini but shall still register myself for the larger Mavic Pro that I already own. I am also looking seriously into getting a PfCO license because that will open up some commercial possibilities, such as learning how to develop apps for the drones I own. I don't have any ideas in particular yet.
