summary: Originally I used Wordpress for all of my CMS needs and then for some projects,
  Drupal. However I was never content with PHP nor the templating systems. Now there
  is JAMStack and I wanted to tell you about the CMS tools I use for this website.

The question is can you use both Forestry and Sanity together? The short answer is “yes” and that is the end of the shortest article ever...

That would be a cop-out and I should explain why I wanted to do this and how easy it is to configure, so long as you are already familiar with some VueJS and Gridsome at least.
